# Networking

This repo contains small projects I've developed to better understand networking.

## Problems

- Shout server: a server written with `syscall` package that defines a connectionless socket that takes incoming data, uppercases it, and returns it
- HTTP header server: a small HTTP server to learn about the listen and accept syscalls
